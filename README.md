# Credit Card Default Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting credit card default payments using the LightGBM model. The aim is to build a reliable machine learning model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to default on their credit card payments. The model utilizes various features such as credit limit, repayment status, education level, marital status, and age to make predictions.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files and directories:

- `data`: This directory holds the dataset used for training and testing the model. Ensure that the dataset is stored in the correct location before running the code.
- `notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `models`: Pickle file of the trained LightGBM model.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Place the dataset in the correct location.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the data, develop the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Run the Python scripts in the collab to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Usage

To use the trained LightGBM model for credit card default prediction, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model using the provided script or notebook.
2. Provide the necessary features (credit limit, repayment status, education level, marital status, and age) for the customer you want to make a prediction for.
3. Apply trasformations on features.
4. Use the model to predict the likelihood of default payment.
5. Make decisions or take actions based on the prediction, such as implementing risk mitigation strategies, adjusting credit limits, or offering personalized repayment plans.
